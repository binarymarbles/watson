# Watson

Watson is the system agent for [Sherlock](https://github.com/tanordheim/sherlock), an open
source infrastructure monitoring application.

This agent is intended to run on systems you want monitored by Sherlock, and it
will push system information to the Sherlock server every minute.

This is still in early stages of development and should not be used in
production as of yet.
